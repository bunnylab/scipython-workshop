I'm going to assume you have some basic familiarity with programming principles such as variables, conditionals and looping.

    "Python is a general purpose, high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed multi-paradigm programming language. It was developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1989 and emphasizes simple readable code and rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- General Purpose: Python is designed to be used for a variety of problems\n",
    "- High-level: Python uses high-level abstractions such as variables and functions and deals with things like memory management for you\n",
    "- Interpreted: Python does not generally use a compiler which converts code from a programming language into machine code to be run by a computer directly. Python code is sent to a program called an interpreter that converts it on the fly for any supported platform. This sacrifices speed for flexibility.\n",
    "- Dynamically Typed: Variables in python do not have a type that you specify in the code (int, string etc.) the interpreter will infer the type of a variable when the code is run.\n",
    "- Multi-Paradigm: Programming paradigms are ways of programming such as object-oriented, functional or procedural which use different abstractions for representing data and manipulations of data. Python contains code for most of these abstractions and so can be used to write programs in any of these styles or in a mix of them."

Floating point numbers will hold decimal numbers of arbitrary size and complex numbers will hold any of the above and include an imaginary component."

Pythons generic types and containers offer a lot of flexibility in terms of dynamic allocation and mixed type operatons, but that flexibility comes at a cost.  The python interpreter has to do a lot of checking on the back end to determine what types are being used, their size in memory and then picking a valid way to operate on them.  This prevents python from doing fast numeric operations, particularly matrix and vector operations with its built in types.  Enter Numpy.\n",

Numpy types and containers are the basis for almost all scientific compuation in python so it is important for us to understand the difference and when to use them. Numpy types are fixed length, you the programmer must decide the appropriate size and type for your needs and protect yourself from issues such as overflows, lost precision in floating point operations and etc. \n",
